  git rebase \
      --strategy-option=theirs \
      --exec 'poetry run ruff check --select ALL . --fix --unsafe-fixes --preview --show-fixes; poetry run ruff format .; git add src tests; git commit --amend --no-edit' \

  Per [Poetry's docs on managing dependencies] and `poetry check`, we had it wrong: Instead of using extras, we should create these:

  ```toml
  [tool.poetry.group.group-name.dependencies]
  dev-dependency = "1.0.0"
  ```

  Which we now do.
